# LNB-Position-Calculator-of-a-offset-dish-in-Python
Greetings, this is a project to create a portable (and offline) version of LNB Position Calculator of a offset dish with GUI based on the online calucator of the below forums,
https://www.satsig.net/pointing/finding-dish-offset-angle.htm, https://ftapinamar.blogspot.com/2012/05/el-foco-en-antenas-offset.html?showComment=1429781145918

All the equations and also the photo in the application are taken from the above two forums. I just convrted it to python and made a simple GUI.

Enjoy,
Dimitris.
