# LNB-Position-Calculator-of-a-offset-dish-in-Python
Greetings, this is a project to create a portable (and offline) version of LNB Position Calculator of a offset dish with GUI based on the online calucator of the below forums,
https://www.satsig.net/pointing/finding-dish-offset-angle.htm, https://ftapinamar.blogspot.com/2012/05/el-foco-en-antenas-offset.html?showComment=1429781145918

Vertical Distance (with reference the ground) of a parabolic offset dish is bigger than the horizontal! Be aware of that when you input the numbers on the fields. Otherwise no result will be produced...

The measuring units must be the same on all the fields. For example, use everywhere mm or cm.

All the equations and also the photo in the application are taken from the above two forums. I just converted it to python and made a simple GUI.

Enjoy,
Dimitris.
